    userStory: "I developed a full stack platform for a company focused on nurturing talents through creative educational resources. The project balanced backend scalability and a responsive, user-friendly frontend. Collaborating closely with the team, I delivered a tool that supports learning and talent development, enriching educational access across the country.",
    techStack: "To build a full stack platform with Python, you can use frameworks like Flask or Django for backend development, alongside PostgreSQL or MongoDB for database management. Frontend development can leverage React.js or Vue.js, with Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for responsive design. DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and NGINX can handle containerization and deployment, while AWS or Google Cloud provides scalable hosting. For testing and monitoring, Pytest, Selenium, and New Relic are essential. Celery with RabbitMQ can manage background tasks, and Swagger or Postman helps with API documentation and testing.",
